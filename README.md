## General info
This project uses Javascript to take the date and time.  <br/>
It uses a function to generate a random weather scenario.  <br/>
Based on the chosen weather scenario, it generates a random, helpful message for what to do in such a weather condition.  <br/>
It then returns all of this information to the user in the form of a string:  <br/>
```JavaScript
return `Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}! The date is ${randDate} and the weather for today is predicted to be ${randWeather}. ${randWeatherMsg}`;
```
## Technologies
* Coded in Visual Studio Code
* JavaScript

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## To-do List
* Add HTML/CSS to be able to showcase the 'weather forecast' via the browser.
