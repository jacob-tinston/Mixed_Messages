# Mixed_Messages
Codecademy Mixed Messages portfolio project.  
This project takes in the date, time of day and generates a random weather forecast. 
Based on the random weather scenario, a random message is printed. 
The message welcomes the user, tells them the time of day, weather and tells them a helpful suggestion based on what the weather is.
